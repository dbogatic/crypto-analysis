## Data Analyzed

* Velocity (VelCur1yr) - The ratio of the value transferred (i.e., the aggregate "size" of all transfers) in the trailing 1 year divided by the current supply on that day. It can be thought of as a rate of turnover -- the number of times that an average native unit has been transferred in the past 1 year.

* Network Value to Transaction (NVTAdj) - The ratio of the network value (or market capitalization, current supply) divided by the adjusted transfer value. Also referred to as NVT.

* Transaction Count (TxCnt) - The sum count of transactions that day. 

* Transaction Volume (TxTfrValAdjUSD) - The USD value of the sum of native units transferred that day removing noise and certain artifacts.

* Exponential Moving Average (EMA) - Technical analysis to determine price movement compared to its average as well as crossing points that could point to trend reversal.
